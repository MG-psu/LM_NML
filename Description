The K-means clustering technique was used for clustering the diseased tissue types, and the Multinomial Logistic Regression (MLR) technique was applied for classifying the diseased tissue types. Dimensionality reduction techniques including Principal Component Analysis and Boruta are used extensively to reduce the dimensionality of genetic and clinical variables. 
Experiments carried out explored to see if either one or both clinical and genetic variables were important in predicting the diseased tissue types. The study established that both types of variables are important. The top three clinical predictors for predicting diseased tissue types were identified as Morphology, Gender, and Age of Diagnosis.
Additionally, this study explored the possibility of using the latent representations of the clusters of landmark and non-landmark genes as predictors for an MLR classifier.
