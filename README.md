# LM_NML_Analysis
# K-means clustering folder of this code contains experiments to compare the performance of the landmark and non-landmark genes in characterizing ten different diseased tissue types. 
# MLR_models folder shows code for constructing Multinomial Logistic Regression (MLR) models using both genetic and clinical data to predict disease types. 
# To reduce the complexity of the dimensions, the feature selection technique Boruta and the dimensionality reduction technique, PCA were used.
# To handle the imbalance in the training dataset, the SMOTE-TOMEK technique was applied.
