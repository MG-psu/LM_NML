This study identifies a subset of genetic and clinical variables that can serve as predictors for classifying diseased tissues/disease types. To achieve this, experiments were performed on diseased tissues obtained from the L1000 dataset to assess differences in the functionality and predictive capabilities of genetic and clinical variables. 
The results showed that landmark genes performed slightly better in clustering diseased tissue types compared to any random set of 978 non-landmark genes, and the difference is statistically significant.
Furthermore, it was shown that both clinical and genetic variables were important in predicting the diseased tissue types. The classification models built using MLR revealed that landmark genes can serve as a subset of genetic variables and/or as a proxy for clinical variables. This study concludes that combining predictive analytics with dimensionality reduction effectively identifies key predictors in precision medicine, enhancing diagnostic accuracy.
